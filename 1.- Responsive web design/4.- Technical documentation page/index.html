                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.</p>
                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

                <h3>Basics.</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
                <code>let Früh = "foobar";</code>
                <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive. In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;). A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                <h3>Comments.</h3>
                <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:</p>
                <code>
                    // a one line comment <br><br>

                    /* this is a longer,<br>
                    * multi-line comment<br>
                    */<br><br>

                    /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
                </code>
                <h3>Declarations.</h3>
                <code>var</code>
                <p>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
                <code>let</code>
                <p>Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>
                <code>const</code>
                <p>Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</p>
                <h3>Variable scope.</h3>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example, the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the global context (or the function context if the code is part of a function). The scope of x is not limited to the immediate if statement block.</p>
                <code>
                    if (true) {<br>
                        var x = 5;<br>
                    }<br>
                    console.log(x);  // x is 5
                </code>
                <p>This behavior changes when using the let declaration (introduced in ECMAScript 2015).</p>
                <code>
                    if (true) {<br>
                        let y = 5;<br>
                    }<br>
                    console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                </code>

                <p>JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an overview of these statements. The semicolon (;) character is used to separate statements in JavaScript code. Any JavaScript expression is also a statement.</p>
                <h3>Block statement.</h3>
                <p>The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets:</p>
                <code>
                    while (x < 10) {<br>
                        x++;<br>
                      }
                </code>
                <h3>Conditional statements.</h3>
                <p>A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch. Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks like this:</p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) {<br>
                        statement_1;<br>
                    } else {<br>
                        statement_2;<br>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement. A switch statement looks like this:</p>
                <code>
                    switch (expression) {<br>
                        case label_1:<br>
                            statements_1;<br>
                            break;<br>
                        case label_2:<br>
                            statements_2;<br>
                            break;<br>
                            …<br>
                        default:<br>
                            statements_default;<br>
                    }
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
                <code>
                    for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {<br>
                        // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.<br>
                        console.log('Walking east one step');<br>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)</p>
                <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>for statement</li>
                    <li>do...while statement</li>
                    <li>while statement</li>
                    <li>labeled statement</li>
                    <li>break statement</li>
                    <li>continue statement</li>
                    <li>for...in statement</li>
                    <li>for...of statement</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters to the function (enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas) and the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}. For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code>
                    function square(number) {<br>
                        return number * number;<br>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>Parameters are essentially passed to functions by value — so if the code within the body of a function assigns a completely new value to a parameter that was passed to the function, the change is not reflected globally or in the code which called that function. When you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example:</p>
                <code>
                    function myFunc(theObject) {<br>
                        theObject.make = 'Toyota';<br>
                    }<br><br>
                      
                    var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};<br>
                    var x, y;<br><br>
                      
                    x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"<br><br>
                      
                    myFunc(mycar);<br>
                    y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"<br>
                                    // (the make property was changed by the function)
                </code>
                <p>Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function square, you could call it as follows:</p>
                <code>
                    square(5);
                </code>
                <p>The preceding statement calls the function with an argument of 5. The function executes its statements and returns the value 25. Functions must be in scope when they are called, but the function declaration can be hoisted (appear below the call in the code), as in this example:</p>
                <code>
                    console.log(square(5));<br>
                    /* ... */<br>
                    function square(n) { return n * n }
                </code>
